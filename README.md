# Priority-Queue
Built a hospital priority queue using Binary Search Tree (BST) to store data of patients' urgent care priority 
Programmed a BST to assign patients a priority integer to treat patients with the most severe cases first
Designed an abstraction class to use as the patients queue where low numbered patients represents higher urgency
Utilized catch to construct test cases which reduced errors and improved patient priority quality
